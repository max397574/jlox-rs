- support `i+=1` or `i++` (or both lol)
- add anonymous functions https://craftinginterpreters.com/functions.html#challenges
- somehow make `print(func)` print out function name
- add `break` statements
- support rust-like ranges in for loops?  for i in 0..=30
- also make and/or stuff be expressions? to allow things like x=3 and x or y? (like in lua)
- consider making variables immutable by default, introduce `mut` keyword (just because I can, as challenge)
- more idiomatic rust
  - error handling with result
  - clean up the operations in interpreter to avoid code duplication
- add additional stuff
  - &&
  - ||
- doesn't add comments to line count (for reporting errors)
- more additional analysis
  - warn about code after return statement
  - `break` not inside loop
