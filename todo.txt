Inheritance

Then done with book

Personal improvements:
- support `i+=1` or `i++` (or both lol)
- add anonymous functions https://craftinginterpreters.com/functions.html#challenges
- somehow make `print(func)` print out function name
- add `break` statements
- support rust-like ranges in for loops?  for i in 0..=30
- also make and/or stuff be expressions? to allow things like x=3 and x or y? (like in lua)
- consider making variables immutable by default, introduce `mut` keyword (just because I can, as challenge)
- more idiomatic rust
  - error handling with result
  - clean up the operations in interpreter to avoid code duplication
- add additional stuff
  - &&
  - ||
- doesn't add comments to line count (for reporting errors)
- something like metatables in lua
  - to allow OOP like this? not needed because classes?
  - and ofc the cool stuff with overwriting addition, calling etc
- more additional analysis
  - warn about code after return statement
  - `break` not inside loop
- add for loop
- stdlib stuff
  - fmt thing (just use format macro from rust?)
  - reading from/to file
  - reading from stdin
  - string operations (find, substring)
  - debugging classes
    - print out e.g. methods
- more types
  - structs
  - enums
  - lists/tables (perhaps like in lua??), just everything with a hashmap
- private/public fields for classes
- immutable variables
- add second `get` method variant to classes which can return nil
  - done with `get_or_nil`
  - actually add syntax to use this. Perhaps indexing class with `?` ?
